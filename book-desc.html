                        <p><strong>Black women physicians’ stories have gone untold for far too long, leaving gaping holes in American medical history, in women’s history, and in black history. It’s time to set the record straight.</strong></p>
                    <article>
                        No real account of black women physicians in the US exists, and what little
                        mention is made of these women in existing histories is often insubstantial or
                        altogether incorrect. In this work of extensive research, Jasmine Brown offers a
                        rich new perspective, penning the long-erased stories of nine pioneering black

                            months after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed and provided medical
                            care for the newly freed slaves who had been neglected and exploited 
                            by the medical system and many more.</p>
